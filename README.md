# Transistor-Logic-with-LEDs
Building logic gates out of transistors, and validating them with LED's.<br>
These circuits might not appear as they conventionally do, when searching them up online. This is because of the added LED's in the circuits.

## Resistor-Transistor Logic (RTL):
RTL refers to digital circuits built using resistors and bipolar junction transistors (BJTs).<br>
RTL is rarely used in modern digital circuits, but was used quite often in the past. A notable example is the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer), which used RTL integrated circuits.
